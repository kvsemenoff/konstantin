			    <p>Already during his studies, Konstantin Wettig discovered his affinity and passion for the real estate business. Over the past two decades, his talent for successful communication, active listening and matching information with the correct recipients have made him an interesting partner for both conversation and business.</p>
			    <p>During 15 years, Konstantin Wettig was a major licensee of the Engel & Völkers global real estate group.</p>
			    <p>In 2014, he sold his Munich-based license holding to a private equity company, allowing him to operate exclusively under his own name.</p>
			    <p>Ever since, Konstantin Wettig has focused on real estate scouting services, i.e. the targeted finding of real estate objects with a high potential value.</p>
			    <p>Information concerning objects to be sold is mainly collected in a discrete manner through his proprietary network, which he has formed over many years.</p>
			    <p>The same platform is used to contact specific prospective business partners. This proven method continues to be the basis for numerous successful transactions. Individuality and a collaboration based on trust provide the foundation for very personal business relationships.</p>
